# Experiment 11(d): Topological Sort

## Aim
To write a Python program to print the topological sorting of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

---

## Algorithm

1. **Create a graph**: 
   - Represent the graph using an adjacency list where each node points to its adjacent nodes (edges).

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Use a DFS approach to traverse the graph. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.
   - For each node, explore all its neighbors recursively.

3. **Departure Array**:
   - Maintain an array to record the nodes in reverse order of their completion times. This will represent the topological order.

4. **Topological Sort**:
   - After DFS completion for all unvisited nodes, print the nodes in the reverse of the departure array to get the topological sorting.

5. **End the program**:
   - Print the topological order of the nodes.
