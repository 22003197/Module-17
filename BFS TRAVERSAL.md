# Experiment 11(b): BFS Traversal

## Aim
To write a Python program to print the BFS (Breadth-First Search) traversal from a given source vertex in a graph.

---

## Algorithm

1. **Start the program**:
   - Create a graph using an adjacency list representation.
   - Add edges between vertices using the `addEdge()` function.

2. **Implement the BFS function**:
   - Initialize all vertices as not visited.
   - Use a queue to track the vertices for traversal.
   - Mark the starting vertex as visited and enqueue it.
   - Dequeue a vertex, process it, and enqueue all its adjacent unvisited vertices while marking them as visited.

3. **Input**:
   - The user provides the starting vertex for the BFS traversal.

4. **Perform BFS traversal**:
   - Start from the given source vertex and traverse all reachable vertices using BFS.
   - Print the vertices in the BFS order.

5. **End the program**:
   - The program outputs the order of vertices visited during the BFS traversal.
